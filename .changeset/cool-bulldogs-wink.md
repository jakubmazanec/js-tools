of the new ones were turned on); 2) added support for Vitest; 3) plugins were updated; 4) support
for Jest was removed; 5) support for Next.js was removed; 6) only TypeScript v5 is supported; 7)
various unnecessary settings were removed; 8) how `@typescript-eslint/parser` finds `tsconfig.json`
files was updated.
